# ReactPortfolio

## Description
As a fullstack web developer, I want to show my experience building single-page applications through my deployed React portfolio to show that I am a good candidate for an open position.

## Usage
To view my single-page application portfolio for web developer, load the portfolio.  You will be presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. The header will present my name and navigation with titles corresponding to different sections of my portfolio.  The navigation titles will present the titles About Me, Portfolio, Contact, and Resume, and the title corresponding to the current section is highlighted. The navigation title will present you with the corresponding section below the navigation without the page reloading and that title is highlighted. When you load the portfolio the first time, the About Me title and section are selected by default. The About Me section will have my recent photo or avatar and my short bio. The Portfolio section will have titled images of six of my applications with links to both the deployed applications and my corresponding GitHub repository. The Contact section will have a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When you move your cursor out of one of the form fields without entering text, you will receive a notification that this field is required. When you enter text into the email address field, you will receive a notification if you have entered an invalid email address. The Resume section will have a link to a downloadable resume and a list of my proficiencies. The footer
will present you with text or icon links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and my profile on a third platform (Stack Overflow, Twitter).
